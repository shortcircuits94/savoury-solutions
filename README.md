Savoury Solutions

## Overview

Savoury Solutions is a dynamic web application that allows users to input a list of ingredients they have on hand and receive customized recipes that they can prepare. This app aims to minimize food waste and inspire users with creative meal ideas based on what is already available in their kitchen.

### Problem Space

Many people struggle to come up with meal ideas based on the ingredients they have at home, leading to wasted food and missed opportunities for creativity in the kitchen. Existing recipe platforms often require users to have specific ingredients, making them less flexible. This app solves these issues by tailoring recipes to the userâ€™s available ingredients, promoting sustainability and convenience.

### User Profile

Primary Users: Home cooks, busy professionals, and students looking for quick and creative meal solutions.

Secondary Users: Individuals focused on reducing food waste or improving their cooking skills.

Users will need an intuitive interface to input their ingredients, browse through recipe suggestions, and save or share their favorite recipes.

### Features

Ingredient Input: Users can manually enter ingredients or select them from a predefined list.

Recipe Recommendations: The app will dynamically generate a list of recipes based on the selected ingredients.

Filters: Users can apply filters such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, or preparation time.

Exclusion Feature: Users can exclude specific ingredients (e.g., allergens) from recipe recommendations.

Recipe Details: Each recipe includes step-by-step instructions, preparation time, and nutritional information.

Favorites: Users can save recipes for future reference.

Sharing: Users can share recipes via social media or email.
